#  HTML5 Base 

## Summary:

HTML5 Base is a simple set of best practices to get web projects off on the right foot.
Adapted from Tim Murtaughs HTML5 Reset

1. A style sheet designed to strip initial files from browsers, meaning you start off with a blank slate.
2. Twitter bootstrap - built from LESS source
3. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
4. Analytics and jQuery snippets in place
5. Meta tags ready for population
6. Empty mobile and print style sheets, including blocks for device orientation
7. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) enables HTML5 compatibility with IE (and a dozen other great features)
8. IE-specific classes for simple CSS-targeting
9. iPhone/iPad/iTouch icon snippets
10. Modx folders for your chunks/snippets/templates to create as static files (allowing versioning)
11. Lots of other keen stuff...
